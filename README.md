# Automated-Answer-Evaluation-Using-BERT-
•	Developed a Python-based system to preprocess and tokenize text using NLTK, transforming raw user answers into clean, analyzable data for automated evaluation. 
•	Leveraged the Sentence-BERT model to compute semantic similarity scores between user-provided answers and reference answers, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing correct answers from incorrect ones based on a defined similarity threshold.
